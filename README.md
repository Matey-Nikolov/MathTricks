# MathTricks

To begin playing the game, you must first open and unzip the "MathTricks" folder. Then open the folder, right-click on the "MathTricks.sln" file, and select "Open with" to run it with Visual Studio (preferably the 2022 version). After opening the .sln file in Visual Studio, find to the "▶️MathTricks" button at the top to begin the game.

After starting the game, you'll be prompted to enter the height and width of the board you'll be playing on, and after entering valid integer numbers (min 4 and max 15), you'll be redirected to another screen where the game will ask you to enter the names of the two players (which could be anything). After that, the game will prompt you to input the coordinates to which you want to go and so earn the corresponding number of points.
